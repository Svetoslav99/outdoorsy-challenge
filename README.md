## Starting the project:

Open the terminal and type "npm run dev"

### If I had a whole week to work on this, I would have implemented:

-   pagination;
-   custom hooks (atleast one for the http requests);
-   unit tests and e2e tests;
-   create pixel-perfect design (with the help of the UI/UX designer and Figma end designs/prototypes, or alone if there is no UI/UX designer);
-   buttons with the different search types so that the user can easily click on them directly;
-   loading spinner animation;
-   I would ask what different features would be nice to be added, and I would have ensured stronger type coverage, refactor the code;
